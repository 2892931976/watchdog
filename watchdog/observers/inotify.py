:synopsis: ``inotify(7)`` based emitter implementation.

.. ADMONITION:: About system requirements

    Quote from the inotify(7) man page:

        "Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel. The required library
        interfaces were added to glibc in version 2.4. (IN_DONT_FOLLOW,
        IN_MASK_ADD, and IN_ONLYDIR were only added in version 2.5.)"

    Therefore, you must ensure the system is running at least these versions
    appropriate libraries and the kernel.

.. ADMONITION:: About recursiveness, event order, and event coalescing.

    Quote from the inotify(7) man page:

        If successive output inotify events produced on the inotify file
        descriptor are identical (same wd, mask, cookie, and name) then they
        are coalesced into a single event if the older event has not yet been
        read (but see BUGS).

        The events returned by reading from an inotify file descriptor form
        an ordered queue. Thus, for example, it is guaranteed that when
        renaming from one directory to another, events will be produced in
        the correct order on the inotify file descriptor.

        ...

        Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor
        subdirectories under a directory, additional watches must be created.

    This emitter implementation therefore automatically adds watches for
    sub-directories if running in recursive mode.
