Watchdog
========
Python API to monitor file system events.

Introduction
------------
Watchdog lets your Python programs monitor filesystem events as
portably as possible using:

* inotify on Linux
* FSEvents on Mac OS X
* polling as a fallback mechanism

Usage:

import sys
import time
from watchdog import Observer, FileSystemEventHandler

class MyEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_moved(self, event):
        # Do something.
        pass

    def on_created(self, event):
        # Do something.
        pass

    def on_deleted(self, event):
        # Do something.
        pass

    def on_modified(self, event):
        # Do something.
        pass

event_handler = MyEventHandler()
observer = Observer()
observer.schedule('a-unique-name', *sys.argv[1:], event_handler)
observer.start()
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    observer.unschedule('a-unique-name')
    observer.stop()
    raise
observer.join()
